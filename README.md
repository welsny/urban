## *urban* 

Look up slang definitions from the comfort of your favorite terminial:

######
```bash
python urban.py bm

> acronym for bad mannered, used by korean computer players. 
```

I highly recommend using a [terminal alias](http://www.techradar.com/us/how-to/computing/apple/terminal-101-creating-aliases-for-commands-1305638) to improve usability:

```bash
urbanpython urban.py hov

> another name for rap artist Jay-Z.  he is alternatively referred to as "J-Hova" as he considers himself to me the messiah of hip hop music.
```
