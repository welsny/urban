Simple script for looking up slang definitions from the comfort of your favorite terminial:

######
```bash
python urban.py bm

I reccommend adding the script to your $PATH to improve usability:

```bash
urban hov

> another name for rap artist Jay-Z.  he is alternatively referred to as "J-Hova" as he considers himself to me the messiah of hip hop music.
